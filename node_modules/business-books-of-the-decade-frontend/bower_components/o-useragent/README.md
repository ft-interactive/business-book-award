# User agent targeting

This module provides a mechanism for marking SASS that exists to target issues in particular user agents and a javascript utility for working with vendor-prefixed properties.

## Browser support
This module has been verified in Internet Explorer 7+, modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, ...) and mobile browsers (Android browser, iOS safari, Chrome mobile).

## Installation

To include `o-useragent` in your module follow the instructions in [the module's page in the Origmai registry](http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-useragent).

## User agent names

While the useragent module does not restrict the identifiers that are used, it only works when everyone uses the same ones.  A user agent identifer is made up of a family name, an optional major version, and an optional minor version.  The family names are:

* `chrome` Google Chrome on Windows, MacOS and Linux
* `ie` Microsoft Internet Explorer on Windows
* `ff` Mozilla Firefox on Windows, MacOS and Linux
* `opera` Opera on Windows, MacOS and Linux
* `safari` Apple Safari on Windows and MacOS
* `chromeandroid` Google Chrome on Android
* `iossafari` Apple Mobile Safari on iOS
* `androidbrowser` OS-integrated browser on Android
* `operamobile` Opera mobile on Android, Windows Phone, Windows, Meego, S60
* `chromeios` Google Chrome on iOS
* `iemobile` Microsoft Internet Explorer on Windows Phone

##Â Usage for UA targeting

Use of the SASS targeting feature of this module comprises three parts:

* providing styles that are targeted to a specified user agent (usually in a component)
* opting in or out of any special rules to target particular user agents (usually in a product)
* adding the appropriate UA-identifying classes to the `<html>` tag of the page (in the product)

### Targeting styles to a specific set of user agents

To target styles at a given user agent use the `oUseragentTarget($useragents[, $versions])` mixin. The mixin accepts two parameters:

 * `$useragents` - a space-separated list of useragents to target, each of which *may* end with a hyphenated version number
 * `$versions` - if `$useragents` specifies a single, unversioned useragent, multiple version numbers can be specified here

The following examples turn the background colour of `<h1>` elements red only in the targeted user agents

```scss
// IE7 and 8, plus all versions of Opera
@include oUseragentTarget(ie7 ie8 opera) {
	h1 { background-color: red }
}

// Firefox 3.2 and 3.3
@include oUseragentTarget(ff, 32 33) {
	h1 { background-color: red }
}
```


### Opting in or out of user agent targeting

When building a product, you may not want components to include CSS in your bundle that targets user agents that you don't intend to support, so you can set your preferences to optimise the size of the generated CSS.

#### Using the build service

If you are generating your style bundle from the build service, all useragent-targeting styles will be included, and will be attached to pre-defined class names based on the syntax `o-useragent-<familyname><majorversion>-<minorversion>`.

#### Using a local build process

If you are [building your product's origami styles locally](http://financial-times.github.io/ft-origami/docs/developer-guide/building-modules/) Sass will by default not include any of the special targeted rules. To output rules intended for useragent X you will need to carry out your own ua-sniffing for X and conditionally add a class of your choice, say `class-X`, to the `<html>` tag. Then in your sass:

```scss
.ie7 { @extend %o-useragent-ie7 !optional; }
.ie8 { @extend %o-useragent-ie8 !optional; }
.ios7 { @extend %o-useragent-iossafari7 !optional; }
```

### Adding the appropriate UA-identifying class to the HTML tag

To use UA-targeted styles, you should detect which user agent is in use, and add the appropriate class names to the `<html>` element.  If you got your CSS bundle via the build service, you need to add `o-useragent`-namespaced classes:

	<html class='o-useragent-ie o-useragent-ie9'>

Note that some UA-targeting might target all versions of IE, while others might target just IE9, so include both.

If you used a local build process, apply the classes to which you remapped the o-useragent placeholders:

	<html class='ie7'>


## Usage for CSS vendor-prefixer

A mixin `oUseragentPrefixer` is provided to prefix css style rules with the vendor prefixes `webkit`, `moz`, `ms` and `o`.

* `oUseragentPrefixer($prop, $val, [$apply-prefix-to-value, [$apply-prefix-to-prop, [$prefixes]])` - generates variants of a style rule for given vendors

	* `$prop` - the style property to be prefixed
	* `$val` - the value to assign to the property
	* `$apply-prefix-to-value` - whether to prefix the value as well as the property (defaults to `false`)
	* `$apply-prefix-to-prop` - whether to prefix the property name (defaults to `true`)
	* `$prefixes` - space separated list of prefixes to apply, defaults to `webkit moz ms o`

Within a product the variable `$o-useragent-vendor-prefixes` (which defaults to `webkit moz ms o`) can be set to alter globally which vendor prefixes should be included in the stylesheet.

## Usage for JavaScript vendor-prefixer

This module also provides a javascript utility, `o-useragent.prefixer` to retrieve vendor-prefixed properties if the browser doesn't yet support it unprefixed.

*Notes:*
* *The prefixed checked for are `webkit`, `moz`, `ms` and `o`.*
* *All the methods support being passed either hyphenated or camel-cased property names and will return a hyphenated or camel-cased string as appropriate*
* *There are a few properties where the prefixed name differs in more than the prefix e.g. matches/webkitMatchesSelector. These can be dealt with by doing something like `prefixer.dom(document.body, 'matches') || prefixer.dom(document.body, 'matchesSelector')`*

### Retrieving prefixed property names
The methods below return the unprefixed name if it exists, failing that they retrieve the prefixed name, or false if the property is not defined at all.

* `o-useragent#prefixer.css(propertyName)`
retrieves the hyphenated css property name
* `o-useragent#prefixer.style(propertyName)`
retrieves the camel-cased style property name
* `o-useragent#prefixer.dom(obj, propertyName)`
retrieves the camel-cased DOM property name e.g

### Retrieving the values stored in prefixed properties

The methods below retrieve the values of prefixed properties defined on given objects.

* `o-useragent#prefixer.getStyleValue(element, propertyName)`
retrieves the value of a HTML element's style property, or false if not defined. if `propertyName` is a space-separated list of values then an object of the following form is returned:

		{
			propertyName1: {
				prefixedName: webkitPrefixedName1,
	            value: 'value1'
			},
			propertyName2: {
				prefixedName: webkitPrefixedName2,
	            value: 'value2'
			}
		}

* `o-useragent#prefixer.getDomProperty(obj, propertyName)`
retrieves the value of a DOM object's property, or false if not defined
* `o-useragent#prefixer.getDomMethod(obj, propertyName, [bindTo])`
retrieves a method of a DOM object bound to that object (or to a different obj if one is passed as a third parameter). Returns false if the property is undefined or not a function
