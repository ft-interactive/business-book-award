## In development:

```
$ npm install 
$ gulp && nf start --port=5001
```
While that’s running, in a new terminal tab run 
```
$ npm run watch
```

Go to http://localhost:3000

If you see a page with content but no styling, try running 'gulp' in a third terminal tab and refresh.


## See changes on your local host:

```
$ gulp

```

Within the views/layout.html file, update the query string on the link tag of the main.css or script tag of the main.bundle.js, depending on changes implemented.
